Instructions: 

main.py is the main code, it requires ORGAN_class.py to run. 

To run a simulation, define the growth variables in main.py and pick a scenario according to the desired differential growth vector ("Delta" in the main.py). It is advised to comment out the computation of unused differential growth terms before running the simulation.

The simulation produces an animation. To save it, choose a name and a location for a file at the bottom of main.py.
