Welcome!

main.py is the main code, it requires ORGAN_class.py to run. 

To run a simulation, define the growth variables in main.py and pick a scenario according to the desired differential growth vector ("Delta" in the main.py).

Then, choose a name and a location for a file at the bottom of main.py, and an animation will be created.
